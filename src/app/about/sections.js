There is nothing more important to the health of a codebase than clean code/ clean architecture, but it means nothing if it doesn't produce real value for the customer right now.",

Serving in leadership roles of progressively increasing scopes of influence and responsibility, I spent my final ten years overseeing an organization of six locations, 26 managers, and more than 300 front-line team members. This was a people role in a people business. ",
  "Software, too, is a people business. Software is for people -- the people who use it, and the people who develop and maintain it. I believe the skills and qualities of character that make a successful leader in the restaurant world are infinitely transferrable; skills like partnering, mentoring, and listening; and qualities like humility, vision, and empathy."
