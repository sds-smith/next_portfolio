# Playing in the Open Source Space  
<p>I made my first code contribution to an open source project in October, 2022. The impetus was that I needed the code to work. I was using a library called [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) in a [small personal project](https://github.com/sds-smith/assemble_the_jams_3) written in TypeScript that leaned on the Spotify API. DefinitelyTyped is a monorepo providing complex type definitions for (among other things) the Spotify API. One of those definitions (for a `/recommendations` request response) was causing problems in my project. A little digging on my part revealed a tiny inconsistency. it was in fact a bug, but whether that bug lived in the codebase of the Spotify web API or the codebase of DefinitelyTyped seems a matter of perspective. So, let's just say 'inconsistency.'</p>
