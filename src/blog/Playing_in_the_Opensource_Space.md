# Playing in the Open Source Space  
<p>I made my first code contribution to an open source project in October, 2022. The impetus was that I needed the code to work. I was using a library called *[DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)* in a [small personal project](https://github.com/sds-smith/assemble_the_jams_3) written in TypeScript that leaned on the Spotify API. </p>
